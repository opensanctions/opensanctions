  National and sub-national Nigerian Politically Exposed Persons collected by Chipper
description: |
  This is a vast dataset of politically exposed persons in Nigeria collected by
  Chipper to support their risk management practices.

  It is not considered to be comprehensive, but significantly augments PEP
  identification data already available on the market.

  Nigeria follows the "Once a PEP, always a PEP" duration practice, meaning people
  may remain in this dataset longer than for data sourced for other jurisdictions.
