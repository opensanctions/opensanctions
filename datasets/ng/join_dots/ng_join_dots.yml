  Data on Politically Exposed Persons in Nigeria and their relatives from the Joining the Dots project.
description: |
  This is a dataset of Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) in Nigeria and their relatives,
  as part of the Joining the Dots project.

  This is a civil-society project using official sources as far as possible,
  complemented by other public sources. It aims to improve natural resource governance in Nigeria 
  by enabling the discovery of relationships between people in political office
  and companies in the extractives industry.

  The Joining the Dots Nigeria project also publishes a dataset of companies in the
  extractives industry and their beneficial owners. It further lists 
  [possible name matches between these beneficial owners and PEPs](https://peps.directoriolegislativo.org/nigeria/monitoring)
  and their relatives.

  However, these matches have not yet been confirmed due to the lack of strong
  identifiers in the available data. This dataset therefore currently only includes the
  PEPs and their relatives, but not the companies or ownership information.
