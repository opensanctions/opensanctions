  > of terrorism and counter-proliferation financing as well as in line with the
  > Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations. The TPPA incorporated the

  > Regulations, 2013 (TPR). The TPPA also expanded the functions of the NSC by
  > identifying it as the body responsible for the implementation of UNSCRs related
