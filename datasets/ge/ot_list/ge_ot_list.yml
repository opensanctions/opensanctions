  The Otkhozoria–Tatunashvili List was originally adopted by the
  parliament of Georgia on June 26, 2018 in response to the killings
  of Archil Tatunashvili and Giga Otkhozoria by separatist authorities
  in Russian-occupied regions of Georgia.  It lists a number of
  individuals who have been found guilty or are awaiting trial for
  crimes such as murder, kidnapping, torture, and inhumane treatment
  against ethnic Georgians.
