  UK company directors can be banned (‘disqualified’) from being a company director
  if they don’t meet your legal responsibilities.

  > ‘Unfit conduct’ includes:
  >
  > * allowing a company to continue trading when it can’t pay its debts
  > * not keeping proper company accounting records
  > * not sending accounts and returns to Companies House
  > * not paying tax owed by the company
  > * using company money or assets for personal benefit

  This is usually handled by the Insolvency Service, but:

  > Apart from The Insolvency Service, other bodies can apply to have you
  > disqualified under certain circumstances, eg:
  > 
  > * Companies House
  > * the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)
  > * the courts
  > * a company insolvency practitioner

  Directors can be disqualified for up to 15 years.
