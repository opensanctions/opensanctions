  Orders from 1939 and 1983 in the Irish Statute Book, based on the Offences Against the State Act 1939
description: |
  This dataset includes the Unlawful Organisation (Suppression) Orders from 1939
  and 1983 as published in the Irish Statute Book. These orders, issued  under
  the authority of the Offences Against the State Act 1939, officially declare
  specific organisations as unlawful due to their involvement in activities that
  threaten public safety and order. The 1983 order designates the Irish National
  Liberation Army (INLA) as an unlawful organisation, while the 1939 order 
  targets the Irish Republican Army (IRA), also known as Oglaigh na héireann.
  Both orders mandate the suppression of these organisations in the public interest.
