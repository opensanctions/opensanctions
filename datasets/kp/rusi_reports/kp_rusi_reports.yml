  A database of entities and events related to North Korea's sanctions
  evasion efforts.
description: |
  > The DPRK Reports database contains structured information relating to the
  > activities of entities that assist North Korea to develop prohibited
  > weapons programmes and evade sanctions. The data is sourced from the
  > United Nations Panel of Experts reports, from 2010 to 2023, as well as
  > the associated UN sanctions resolutions.

  > It includes profiles of the persons, companies, organizations, and vessels
  > that are mentioned in the reports, and contains information such as
  > names, aliases, locations, contact details and sanction designation
  > status. The database also records the relationships between entities
  > and their involvement or relationship to specific events.

  > The objective of this database is to provide national authorities and
  > private-sector institutions with information that can assist with
  > sanctions implementation efforts such as due diligence and compliance.

  The original data contains a rich set of source documents which we've 
  excluded from the entity network we've imported into OpenSanctions.
