description: |
  This dataset comprises information about current deputies in Mexico,
  who represent the lower house of the Mexican Congress known as the House of Representatives.
  It is constituted with a total of 500 seats. Of these, 300 "majority deputies" are directly
  elected by plurality from single-member districts, the federal electoral districts
  (with each state divided into at least two districts). The remaining 200
  "party deputies" are assigned through rules of proportional
  representation. Each deputy serves a three-year term.
