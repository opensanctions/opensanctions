  This dataset comprises information about current deputies in Mexico who
  represent the lower house of the Mexican Congress, known as the House of
  Representatives.

  It is constituted with a total of 500 seats. Of these, 300 "majority deputies"
  are directly elected by plurality from single-member districts, the federal
  electoral districts (with each state divided into at least two districts).
  The remaining 200 "party deputies" are assigned through rules of proportional
  representation. Each deputy serves a three-year term.
