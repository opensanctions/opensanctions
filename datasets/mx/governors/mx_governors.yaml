  This dataset includes information about current and
  former state governors from Mexico.

  Mexico is a federation comprising 32 states, each with its own governor. The
  Head of Government of Mexico City is not considered a governorship but is
  included in this list.

  State governors serve six-year terms, and, similar to the President of Mexico,
  they are prohibited from seeking reelection. Individuals who have previously
  held a governorship are ineligible to run for or serve in the post again.
