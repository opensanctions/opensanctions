  Current and former state governors from Mexico
description: |
  This dataset includes information about current and
  former state governors from Mexico. Mexico is a
  federation comprising 32 states, each with its own
  governor. The Head of Government of Mexico City is
  not considered a governorship but is included in this list.
  State governors serve six-year terms, and, similar to
  the President of Mexico, they are prohibited from
  seeking reelection. Individuals who have previously
  held a governorship are ineligible to run for or serve in the post again.
