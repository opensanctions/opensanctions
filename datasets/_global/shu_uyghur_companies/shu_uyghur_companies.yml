  This dataset highlights the corporate landscape of the Uyghur Region, including 
  companies involved in manufacturing, export, professional services, construction, 
  telecommunications, and retail. It provides names, addresses, and sectors in both 
  Chinese and English. The dataset also includes companies related to UFLPA priority 
  sectors such as apparel, tomato, and polysilicon.

  Its purpose is to provide a better understanding of the economic landscape in the 
  Uyghur Region amid ongoing human rights concerns. This list represents publicly 
  available information and is not an original research product of the authors or 
  of Sheffield Hallam University.

  The companies listed under *"Companies Operating in the Uyghur Region"* are based there, 
  while those under *"Companies Named in Media and Academic Reports as Engaging in Labour 
  Transfers or Other XUAR Government Programs"* are identified in reports for their involvement 
  in labor transfers or other government programs in the region.

  **Note:** This data is static and will be updated when new files become available.
  This list is not exhaustive, nor does it provide data on companies that were 
  registered, de-registered, or otherwise changed status after that time.
  English translation is machine-generated and may not be accurate.
