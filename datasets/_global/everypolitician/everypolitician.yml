  All members of national legislatures in the world, collected from hundreds of
  government web sites and consolidated via Wikidata.

  The EveryPolitician project ran until 2019 and created a mechanism for consolidating 
  data about members of parliament for 233 different countries and territories. As part
  of the project, EveryPolitician operated a large fleet of crawlers which read the web
  sites of parliaments around the world.

  The project was [shut down in June 2019](https://www.mysociety.org/2019/06/26/placing-everypolitician-on-hold/)
  ceasing updates to this dataset.
  
  OpenSanctions continues to include members from this dataset which meet our standard
  criteria of PEP classification: national legislature members are included for 20 years
  after they held a position if an end date is known, otherwise for 40 years after they
  entered the position. They are excluded 5 years after their death, or 120 years
  after their birth.

  Other sources will eventually replace this dataset completely as we continually
  improve PEP coverage through more current sources.
