  The EveryPolitician project ran until 2019 and created a mechanism for consolidating
  data about members of parliament for 233 different countries and territories. As part
  of the project, EveryPolitician operated a large fleet of crawlers which read the web
  sites of parliaments around the world.

  The project was [shut down in June 2019](https://www.mysociety.org/2019/06/26/placing-everypolitician-on-hold/)
  ceasing updates to this dataset.

  OpenSanctions continues to include members from this dataset which meet our standard
  criteria of PEP classification: national legislature members are included for 20 years
  after they held a position if an end date is known, otherwise for 40 years after they
  entered the position. They are excluded 5 years after their death, or 120 years
  after their birth.

  Other sources will eventually replace this dataset completely as we continually
  improve PEP coverage through more current sources.
deprecation: |
  In June 2019, [MySociety announced](https://www.mysociety.org/2019/06/26/placing-everypolitician-on-hold/) that
  the EveryPolitician project was being placed on hold and that no further updates would be made to this dataset.

  OpenSanctions imports data from EveryPolitician only for the purpose of maintaining historical coverage of PEPs,
  and will eventually replace this source with more current datasets.

  We are also working to relaunch the [EveryPolitician website](https://www.everypolitician.org/) as a public data
  resource in the future.
