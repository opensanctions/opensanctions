    The Security Council has primary responsibility for the maintenance of international 
    peace and security. Under the Charter of the United Nations, all Member States are 
    obligated to comply with Council decisions.

    The Security Council takes the lead in determining the existence of a threat to the 
    peace or act of aggression. It calls upon the parties to a dispute to settle it by 
    peaceful means and recommends methods of adjustment or terms of settlement. In some 
    cases, the Security Council can resort to imposing sanctions or even authorize the 
    use of force to maintain or restore international peace and security.
