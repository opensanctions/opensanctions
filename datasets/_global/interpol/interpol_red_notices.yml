  From the [INTERPOL site](https://www.interpol.int/en/How-we-work/Notices/Red-Notices):

  > A Red Notice is a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and
  > provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar
  > legal action.
  >
  > It contains two main types of information:
  > 
  > Information to identify the wanted person, such as their name, date of
  > birth, nationality, hair and eye colour, photographs and fingerprints
  > if available.
  > Information related to the crime they are wanted for, which can typically
  > be murder, rape, child abuse or armed robbery. 
  > Red Notices are published by INTERPOL at the request of a member country,
  > and must comply with INTERPOLâ€™s Constitution and Rules. A Red Notice is
  > not an international arrest warrant.
