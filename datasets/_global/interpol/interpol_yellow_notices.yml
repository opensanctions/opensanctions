  From the [INTERPOL site](https://www.interpol.int/en/How-we-work/Notices/Yellow-Notices):

  > A Yellow Notice is a global police alert for a missing person. It is
  > published for victims of parental abductions, criminal abductions
  > (kidnappings) or unexplained disappearances.
  > 
  > The Yellow Notice can also be used to help identify a person who is
  > unable to identify himself or herself.
  > 
  > This is a valuable law enforcement tool that can increase the chances
  > of a missing person being located, particularly if there is a possibility
  > that the person might travel, or be taken, abroad.
