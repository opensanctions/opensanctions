  description: |
    ADB was conceived in the early 1960s as a financial institution that would be Asian
    in character and foster economic growth and cooperation in one of the poorest
    regions in the world.
    It was established by a resolution passed at the first Ministerial Conference on
    Asian Economic Cooperation held by the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia
    and the Far East in 1963.
