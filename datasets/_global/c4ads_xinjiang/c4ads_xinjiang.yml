  Companies linked to the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC)

  > Companies perpetrating forced labor and human rights abuses in the Xinjiang Uyghur
  > Autonomous Region (Xinjiang) are enmeshed in global trade and finance despite severe
  > multilateral sanctions designed to cut them off from international markets. This is
  > a result of their integration with the corporate, trade, and financial landscape
  > within Xinjiang, China, and the greater region. This report uses the Xinjiang
  > Production and Construction Corps (XPCC)—a regional governing body with a vast
  > commercial network—as a test case to better understand how perpetrators of human
  > rights abuse in Xinjiang retain access to international markets. Analysis of publicly
  > available information reveals that sanctions and international outrage have been
  > insufficient in preventing the XPCC from accessing global markets, allowing it
  > to continue profiting from forced labor and other forms of oppression.
