  periods indicated.

  The World Bank Group (IBRD, IDA) maintain a list of companies that are not 
  allowed to be awarded projects by its member organisations. Entities are added
  either as a consequence of a sanctioning process within the bank (see [here](https://policies.worldbank.org/en/policies/all/ppfdetail/3872) 
  for details), or via cross-sanctioning from one of the following other international
  development banks: 

  * Asian Development Bank
  * European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
  * Inter-American Development Bank
  * African Development Bank

  nb. This cross-debarment process looks to be somewhat manual. OpenSanctions should
  crawl all of the involved banks and reconcile their lists.

  ### Notes

  * For entities that have been permanently excluded from procurement, the sanction end
    date is given as 2999-12-31.
