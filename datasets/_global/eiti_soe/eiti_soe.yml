  EITI-implementing countries. The information is provided to facilitate the detection and 
  prevention of corruption.

  name: Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative
  acronym: EITI
  description: |
    By becoming a member of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), countries commit 
    to disclose information along the extractive industry value chain – from how extraction rights are 
    awarded, to how revenues make their way through government and how they benefit the public. The EITI 
    provides data that can help identify and close channels for corruption – not only in mining, oil and 
    gas but increasingly in the renewables sector.    

    In each country that has joined the EITI, a multi-stakeholder group, composed of government, companies 
    and civil society, supports implementation of the EITI Standard.
