  Cryptocurrency addresses linked to payments for ransomware attacks
description: |
  Ransomware is a form of malware designed to encrypt files on a device, rendering
  any files and the systems that rely on them unusable. Malicious actors then demand
  ransom in exchange for decryption.

  Cryptocurrencies have, in recent years, become a common method to transact ransom
  payments in such attacks. The [ransomwhe.re](https://ransomwhe.re) site collects
  addresses (accounts) that are known to be linked to these payments.
