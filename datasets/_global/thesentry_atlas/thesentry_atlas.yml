  Atlas is a data project created by The Sentry. It maps, visualizes, and analyzes
  networks that benefit from violent conflict, repression, and kleptocracy, highlighting
  key insights into how these networks operate. Atlas aims to put the relevant data in
  the hands of journalists, policy makers, financial institutions and other private sector
  actors, and the public so that those responsible for large-scale violence and grand
  corruption can face real consequences.

  Atlas projects maintain the same rigorous methodological approach and high evidentiary
  standards that are required of all Sentry products. Each project includes a list of
  citations and an explanation of the methodology used.

  This dataset currently includes the following projects:
