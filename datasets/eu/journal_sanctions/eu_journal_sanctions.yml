    and concluding agreements between the EU and other countries and organizations.

summary: >-
  Supplemental list of people, companies, and organizations sanctioned
  for involvement in Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
description: |
  The European Union publishes a [consolidated sanctions list](/datasets/eu_fsf/)
  as a primary data source for sanctioned entities. However, sanctions are first
  published in the Official Journal of the EU (OJEU) and take immediate effect
  when published.

  The transposition of those new sanctions into the consolidated file has often
  involved a significant delay (over 20 days in one case). That means that relying
  on the the consolidated list along would lead to significant legal risk. This
  dataset exists as a bridging mechanism to provide immediate access to the
  latest sanctions data, based on manual analysis of the Official Journal.
