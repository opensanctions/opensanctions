  Supplemental list of people, companies, and organizations sanctioned
  for involvement in Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
description: |
  Annex IV to Regulation 2023/2878, replacing Annex IV to Regulation
  (EU) No 833/2014, lists persons, entities and bodies directly
  supporting Russia’s military and industrial complex in its war of
  aggression against Ukraine, on which tighter export restrictions
  regarding dual-use goods and technology, as well as goods and
  technology which might contribute to the technological enhancement
  of Russia’s defence and security sector, are imposed.

  In addition, in view of the key enabling role of electronic
  components for use by Russia’s military and industrial complex in
  supporting the war of aggression against Ukraine, this list also
  includes certain entities in third countries other than Russia
  involved in the circumvention of trade restrictions, as well as
  certain Russian entities involved in the development, production and
  supply of electronic components for Russia’s military and industrial
  complex.
