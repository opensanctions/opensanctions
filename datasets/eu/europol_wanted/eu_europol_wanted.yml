  Europe's most wanted fugitives is a collaboration of several Fugitive
  Active Search Teams (ENFAST) in EU Member States, whose administrators
  upload their countries’ most wanted fugitives, and will directly
  receive any leads about them.

  The ENFAST project aims to increase security within the European Union
  by improving efficiency in tracing and arresting internationally wanted
  criminals, who committed serious crimes. 

  ENFAST is a network of police officers available 24/7 who can immediately
  undertake action to locate and arrest fugitives.
