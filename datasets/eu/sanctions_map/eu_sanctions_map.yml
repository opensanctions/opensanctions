  The EU Sanctions Map is a visualisation of EU sanctions policy. It includes a broader
  set of policies and entities than the EU consolidated sanctions list.
description: |
  The EU Sanctions Map web site mostly includes the same data as the
  [EU Consolidated List](/datasets/eu_fsf/), which is not repeated here. However, certain
  EU sanction types (which do not involve asset freezes) are not included in the main list,
  but featured on the Sanctions Map.

  > The EU Sanctions Map provides information on restrictive measures (sanctions) adopted
  > by the European Union - either to transpose measures imposed by the United Nations
  > Security Council or autonomously. The EU Sanctions Map does not provide information on
  > national sanctions of the EU Member States or any other sanctions imposed by third states.

  Explanation of the EC regarding the scope difference with the EU FSF:

  > The Consolidated Financial Sanctions List only includes persons, groups and entities
  > subject, under EU restrictive measures (sanctions), to an asset freeze and the
  > prohibition to make funds and economic resources available to them.

  > Entities contained in Annex IV of Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 are subject to
  > specific economic prohibitions as referred to in Article 2(7), 2a(7) and 2b(1) of
  > Regulation (EU) No 833/2014. They are, however, not subject to an asset freeze, hence
  > not included in the Consolidated list.
