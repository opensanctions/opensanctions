    The Cordillera Autonomous Region was established in 1987, leading to the creation of the Police Regional Office Cordillera,
    which is responsible for maintaining peace and order in the Cordillera Region. The Philippine Constabulary was replaced by
    the Philippine National Police in January 1991. Their main duty is to enforce the law, prevent and control crimes,
    maintain peace and order, and ensure public safety and internal security with the active support of the community.
