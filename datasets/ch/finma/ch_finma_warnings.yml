  Switzerland's financial regulator maintains and publishes a warning list of
  companies and individuals who may be carrying out unauthorised services
description: |
  > FINMA checks the companies and individuals on its warning list to see if
  > they are providing unauthorised services. The findings, however, have so
  > far been inconclusive because the companies and individuals concerned
  > have not complied with the requirement to provide information, or the
  > information they provided is false. Moreover, when FINMA investigations
  > reveal an imminent and considerable threat to investors, the providers
  > involved are also entered in the list. The fact that a company is on
  > FINMA’s warning list does not automatically mean that its activities are
  > unlawful. Their entry in the list does, however, highlight the lack of
  > authorisation. The companies and individuals in question will be removed
  > from the list once FINMA has completed its investigations and taken any
  > appropriate measures.
