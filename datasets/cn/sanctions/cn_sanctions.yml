  Individuals and organisations targeted by the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law,
  Counter-Measures List and the Unreliable Entities List (UEL).
description: |
  China does not publish structured data on individuals and entities targeted by the
  country's sanctions legislation. This dataset is a partial list of individuals and
  organisations that have been mentioned by spokespeople of the government as
  designated.

  Chinese sanctions are often framed as countermeasures against foreign sanctions
  and to reprimand public figures for critizing China's policies, particularly
  regarding Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Xinjiang province.

  As of 2024-03-08, only two companies are officially listed as part of the Unreliable
  Entities List (UEL).

  **Note**: This dataset is not comprehensive and should be used as a research
  tool but not as a definitive source of sanctions data on China.
