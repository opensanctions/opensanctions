  The BrightQuery Business Identity API provides firmographic and legal entity level
  information for millions of US organizations, enabling enriched organization profiles.
description: |
  BrightQuery (BQ) provides company and legal entity data for approximately 74 million
  U.S. organizations. It includes corporate family structures, legal status, firmographics,
  compliance checks, headcount, revenue, and other key attributes. BQ aggregates and normalizes
  data from multiple sources, delivering accurate and up-to-date information for identity
  verification, risk assessment, market analysis, and business intelligence.

  The key advantage of this dataset is that it makes it straightforward to link entities in
  OpenSanctions to corresponding companies in the BrightQuery directory. This enables richer
  profiles, more detailed context, and deeper analysis when combining sanctions data with
  corporate information.
