  National Provider Identifier (NPI) Registry containing information about health care
  providers in the United States, including individual practitioners and organizational providers.
description: |
  The National Provider Identifier (NPI) is a unique 10-digit identification number issued to
  health care providers in the United States by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).
  The NPI Registry contains FOIA-disclosable data about both individual health care providers
  (such as physicians, nurses, and dentists) and organizational providers (such as hospitals,
  clinics, and nursing homes).

  The registry includes provider names, practice locations, taxonomy codes, contact information,
  and other identifying information. Both active and deactivated NPIs are included in the dataset.

  Note: An NPI does not ensure or validate that the health care provider is licensed or credentialed.
