summary: >-
  Cypriot open data on companies, which names officers but no shareholders.
description: |
  > Register of registered organizations in Cyprus, kept at the office of
  > the Registrar of Companies and Intellectual Property. The register
  > includes 5 types of organizations:
  > 
  > (a) Companies
  > (b) Foreign Companies
  > (c) Trade Names
  > (d) Cooperatives
  > (e) Old Cooperatives (BN)

  The register only includes officers (mostly directors), which are usually
  nominees. It fails to list the shareholder information that would be essential
  to tracking asset ownership via Cyprus.
