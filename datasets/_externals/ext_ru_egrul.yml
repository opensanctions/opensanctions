  Companies database of the Russian Federation as maintained and published by
  the Federal Tax Service.
description: |
  The tax database of legal entities is probably the most detailed part of the
  companies registry (other fragments are maintained by the statistics body and
  others). The registry data must be purchased from the tax authority, but a
  full version of it has been released online by a Russian IT entrepreneur.

  This dataset contains entities up to the latest snapshot available to
  OpenSanctions. Additionally, it is augmented with historic ownership and
  directorship data, sourced from snapshots of the source database dating back to
  2022-01-01. This is to compensate any information loss due to intra-war data
  removals, as the Government of the Russian Federation has [limited reporting duties for
  legal entities that are subject to foreign restrictive measures](http://publication.pravo.gov.ru/Document/View/0001202203180028?index=1).
