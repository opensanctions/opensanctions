  A concatenated data file of all entities which have been issued Legal
  Entity Identifier (LEI) codes
description: |
  Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) are global company identification numbers. They
  are meant to be used in international transactions in the future, backed by an
  ISO-developed standard.

  The GLEIF group assembles a database of all entities which have been issued an
  LEI and is published as open data on the web.

  ### Using the full data

  In order to match GLEIF data with OpenSanctions, we've converted the full GLEIF
  database to the FollowTheMoney data format used by our system. You can download
  the [raw data and use it in full](https://github.com/opensanctions/gleif)
  (updated daily).
