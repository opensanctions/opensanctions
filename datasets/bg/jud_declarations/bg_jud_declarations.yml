  This dataset provides a list of judges, prosecutors, and investigators in Bulgaria with links
  to their asset declarations.

  Article 175 of the Judicial System Act (Закон за съдебната власт) outlines the requirements 
  and procedures for asset and interest declarations by judges, prosecutors, and investigators 
  in Bulgaria. These provisions require senior members of the judiciary to disclose their assets 
  and interests annually, with mandatory updates for significant changes. This process identifies 
  politically-exposed persons within Bulgaria's judiciary.
