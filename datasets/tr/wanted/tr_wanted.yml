  List of people considered wanted for terrorism by the Türkiye Ministry of Interior
description: |
  Türkiye has published a list of its most wanted terrorists, which includes
  details such as names, birth years, and places of birth. 

  These individuals are classified into five color-coded categories,
  ranging from red (kırmızı) — indicating the most wanted — to blue (mavi),
  green (yeşil), orange (turuncu), and grey (gri). 

  Each category corresponds to a different reward amount for information
  that leads to the capture of these wanted individuals.

  **Note**: There are concerns about the list lacking a proper legal
  foundation due to the absence of a legal provision that regulates who
  can be included, how individuals can be removed, and how authorities can
  establish or manage the list.
