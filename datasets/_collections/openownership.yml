  Corporate ownership records from various countries published using Open Ownership's
  Beneficial Ownership Data Standard (BODS).
description: |
  The data in this collection is full beneficial ownership registers, not just the
  subsets which are adjacent to sanctioned or other risky entities and thus included
  in the [OpenSanctions default](/datasets/default/) dataset. This data is not fully
  internally resolved in the same way that the rest of OpenSanctions is.

  For the UK PSC and Latvian beneficial ownership database, we retrieve the data
  directly from their respective data publishers in order to guarantee a weekly
  refresh cycle.
