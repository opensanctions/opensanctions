summary: >
  Entities from all the datasets in OpenSanctions, including sanctions,
  politically exposed person and criminal figures. This collection exists
  mainly for technical reasons - in practice you probably want to use
  a more specific collection instead.
description: |
  Please consider using the [Due Diligence List](/datasets/default/)
  instead of this dataset. While this dataset is more comprehensive, it may
  include entities from sources that have not yet passed all quality checks
  or are not directly related to screening tasks.
deprecation:
  This collection contains testing/experimental datasets and must under no
  circumstances be used in production systems. Please use the
  [default dataset](/datasets/default/) instead.
