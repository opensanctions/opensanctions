  Sanctioned companies from a selected set of European and US sanctions lists,
  and their associated securities identifiers, including LEI and ISIN codes.
description: |
  This collection produces a [specialised export of all sanctioned
  organizations](/docs/data/securities/), with a column to designate their
  LEI codes, where available. We also include a column that lists all known
  ISINs associated with each company.

  The table also lists all Russian companies that have been assigned an ISIN,
  and thus are subject to investment bans under US Executive Order (EO) 14071.
