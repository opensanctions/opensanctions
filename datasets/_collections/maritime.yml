  A shipping-focussed data subset for screening vessels, operators and owners against sanctions.
description: |
  This collection contains maritime-related sanctions data, featuring vessels, and organizations
  linked to them. The dataset includes all watchlists that are relevant to maritime operations,
  ie. that indicate vessels as sanctioned entities.

  The CSV data structure is as follows:
  - **type**: Either VESSEL, or ORGANIZATION. Organizations are only included, if one of our
    data sources provides an IMO number assigned to that company or entity. All vessels are
    included in the data export, irrespective of whether an IMO number is available or not.
  - **caption**: The name of the vessel or organization. See [caption](/faq/24/captions/) on how
    a name is picked from available candidates.
  - **imo**: The IMO number of the vessel or organization. This is a unique identifier for vessels
    and organizations. IMO numbers are assigned by the International Maritime Organization, and
    different schemes are used for vessels and organizations. If no IMO number is available for
    a vessel, the field is empty. In those cases, more brittle matching on name may be required.
  - **risk**: Whether the vessel or organization is directly sanctioned, or is mentioned on a
    watchlist in a secondary capacity. See [topics](/docs/topics/).
  - **countries**: All countries that the vessel or organization has been linked to.
  - **flag**: The flag of the vessel. This is the country that the vessel is registered in.
  - **mmsi**: The MMSI number of the vessel. This is a unique identifier for vessels, and is
    assigned by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). It is used for maritime
    communication and navigation. If no MMSI number is available for a vessel, the field is empty.
  - **id**: The OpenSanctions ID for the vessel or organization.
  - **url**: Link to the OpenSanctions profile regarding the vessel or organization.
  - **datasets**: The list of datasets that mention the vessel or organization. This is a list of
    OpenSanctions dataset IDs, and can be used to find out where the data comes from.
  - **aliases**: A list of all names that are linked to the vessel or organization, except for
    the name that is used in the `name` field.
