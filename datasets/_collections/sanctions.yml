summary: >
  Consolidated list of sanctioned entities designated by different
  countries and international organisations. This can include military,
  trade and travel restrictions.
description: |
  This collection combines all designated entities from the various sanctions
  lists included in OpenSanctions. It represents the broadest set of
  sanctioned people, companies and other assets that is designated globally.

  Virtually all sanctions lists are based on the [UN Security Council List](/datasets/un_sc_sanctions/),
  and add further listings based on national policies.

  The sanctions included here generally impose one or more restrictions like

  * freezing of assets
  * banning financial transactions, except sometimes for personal living expenses
  * travel bans

  They may be imposed as a consequence of activities such as funding or association
  with organisations involved in terrorism or human rights abuses, or for other
  geopolitical reasons.

  This excludes restrictions sometimes termed as sanctions such as those imposed
  by financial regulators for financial misconduct, or debarments restricting procurement.
  Those are included in the [Crime collection](/datasets/crime) instead.
