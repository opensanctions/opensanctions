description: |
  The Canadian government maintains a list of universities, research institutes
  and/or laboratories connected to military, national defence, or state security
  entities that could pose a risk to Canada’s national security.

  To ensure compliance with the Policy on Sensitive Technology Research and
  Affiliations of Concern, all researchers involved in activities funded by a
  research grant that advance a sensitive technology research area must review
  the list of Named Research Organizations. This list is composed of research
  organizations and institutions that pose the highest risk to Canada’s national
  security due to their direct, or indirect connections with military, national
  defence, and state security entities.
