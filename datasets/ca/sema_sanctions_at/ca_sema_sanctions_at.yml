  Regulations against individuals and entities under the Special Economic Measures Act (SEMA) prohibit persons in Canada and
  Canadians outside Canada from engaging in any activity related to any property of these listed entities
  or providing financial or related services to them. Canada is also imposing sanctions against ships,
  based on their involvement in transporting property and goods for the benefit of Russia or a person in Russia.
  This is in addition to the existing categories of ships prohibited from docking in or passing through Canada under Regulation 3.04.
