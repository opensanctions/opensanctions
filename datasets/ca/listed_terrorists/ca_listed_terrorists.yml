  The Canadian governments own list of people and organizations associated with 
  terrorism
description: |
  > The listing of an entity is a public means of identifying a group or individual as
  > being associated with terrorism. The definition of an entity includes a person,
  > group, trust, partnership or fund, or an unincorporated association or
  > organization. The [Anti-Terrorism Act](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-11.7/index.html)
  > provides measures for the Government of Canada to create a list of entities.

  > It is not a crime to be listed. However, one of the consequences of being listed is
  > that the entity's property can be the subject of seizure/restraint and/or forfeiture.
  > In addition, institutions such as banks, brokerages, etc. are subject to
  > reporting requirements with respect to an entity's property and must not allow
  > those entities to access the property.  These institutions may not deal or
  > otherwise dispose of the property. It is an offence to knowingly participate
  > in or contribute to, directly or indirectly, any activity of a terrorist group.
  > This participation is only an offence if its purpose is to enhance the ability of
  > any terrorist group to facilitate or carry out a terrorist activity.
