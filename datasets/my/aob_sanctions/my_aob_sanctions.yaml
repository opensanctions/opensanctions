  financial statement does not give a true and fair view.

    provisions of Part IIIA of the SCA or any condition,
    written notice or guidelines;
    - Reprimand;
    - Requiring professional education to be undertaken;
    - Assigning a reviewer to oversee an audit
    that is undertaken by the auditor concerned;
    - Financial penalty of not exceeding RM500,000;
    - Prohibit the person concerned from accepting any
    public interest entity or schedule fund as its clients
    or preparing reports in relation to financial
    information of any public interest entity or schedule
    fund, as may be required under the securities laws
    or guidelines issued by the Commission,
    for a period not exceeding twelve months; and
    - Prohibit the person concerned from auditing financial
    statements or preparing reports in relation to
    financial information of a public interest entity
