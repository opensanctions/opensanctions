  Current and recent Members of the French Senate with itemised terms of office
description: |
  This dataset lists the members of the French Senate.

  The data is collected from the open data platform for the Senate
  (Sénat), which is the upper legislative chamber of the French
  Parliament.  The Senate is composed of 348 senators elected to
  six-year terms, with half of its seats elected every three years.

  The primary role of the Senate is to represent the territorial
  entities (communes, départements, regions, overseas territories) of
  France.  As such, it is elected not by popular suffrage but by an
  electoral college composed of elected officials of these local
  governments.

  The function of the Parliament (including the Senate and the
  National Assembly) is to examine and pass laws and to verify and
  evaluate public policy and the functioning of the government.
