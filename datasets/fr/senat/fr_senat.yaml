  This dataset lists the serving members of the French Senate.

  The data is collected from the open data platform for the Senate,
  which is the upper legislative chamber of the French government.  The
  Senate is composed of 348 senators elected to six-year terms, with
  half of its seats elected every three years.

  The primary role of the Senate is to represent the territorial
  entities (communes, départements, regions, overseas territories) of
  France.  As such, it is elected not by popular suffrage but by an
  electoral college composed of elected officials of these local
  governments.

  The function of the Parliament (including the Senate and the
  National Assembly) is to examine and pass laws and to verify and
  evaluate public policy and the functioning of the government.
