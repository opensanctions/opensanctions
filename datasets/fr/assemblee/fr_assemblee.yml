  Members of the French National Assembly.

  This dataset lists the members of the French National Assembly.

  The data is collected from the open data platform for the National
  Assembly (Assemblée Nationale), which is the lower legislative
  chamber of the French Parliament.  The National Assembly is composed
  of 577 members (députés) elected to five-year terms.

  In contrast to the Senate, which represents the local and regional
  governments (collectivités), the National Assembly represents the
  people, and is elected by popular suffrage, by a two-round system in
  single-member constituencies.  The number of constituencies is
  proportional to the population, with the exception that each
  département must have at least two representatives, and
  constituencies may not cross departmental boundaries.

  The function of the Parliament (including the Senate and the
  National Assembly) is to examine and pass laws and to verify and
  evaluate public policy and the functioning of the government.
