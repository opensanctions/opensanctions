description: |
  This dataset contains a list of employers deemed by Ministry of Labour and Employment of Brazil to have subjected
  workers to working conditions analogous to slavery. The ministry itself describes the list as follows (translated):

  > Work carried out in conditions analogous to slavery is considered to be that which results from the following
  > situations, either as a whole or in isolation: the subjection of a worker to forced labor; the subjection of a
  > worker to exhausting working hours; the subjection of a worker to degrading working conditions; the restriction of
  > the worker's locomotion, whether due to a debt contracted, or by restricting the worker's use of any means of
  > transport, or by any other means with the aim of retaining them at the workplace; ostentatious surveillance at the
  > workplace by the employer or his agent, with the aim of detaining the worker at the workplace; possession of the
  > worker's personal documents or objects by the employer or his agent, with the aim of detaining the worker at the
  > workplace.

  > One of the objectives of the Ministry of Labor and Social Security is to eradicate slave and degrading labor,
  > through tax actions coordinated by the Labor Inspection Secretariat, in previously mapped out hotspots. The Labor
  > Inspectorate aims to regularize the employment relationships of the workers found and other consequences and free
  > them from the condition of slavery.
