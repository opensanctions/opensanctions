  The National Register of Ineligible and Suspended Companies (CEIS) lists individuals and companies sanctioned from public procurement in Brazil.
description: |
  The CEIS is an essential part of Brazil's Portal da TransparÃªncia,
  providing a comprehensive list of individuals and companies that have faced sanctions restricting
  their ability to participate in public tenders or contract with the public administration.
  These sanctions include temporary suspension, declaration of ineligibility,
  and other penalties under various Brazilian laws like the Bidding Law and the Anti-Corruption Law.

  The CEIS not only promotes transparency for citizens but also serves
  as a crucial reference for public managers in governmental procurement processes, 
  ensuring compliance at all federal levels. 

  The database is maintained under the mandate of the Anti-Corruption Law (Law No. 12.846/2013),
  with the entries being directly fed by public entities responsible for the sanctions.
