  The War and Sanctions website provides detailed information on ongoing sanctions targeting 
  Russia and its allies, alongside profiles of individuals and entities that actively support 
  the war against Ukraine but remain unsanctioned by Western nations. The dataset is 
  categorized into the following sections:

  **Child Kidnappers**: Individuals and entities involved in the deportation of Ukrainian 
  children.

  **Champions of Terror**: Athletes whom Russia uses to propagate its agenda.
  
  **Marine and Aircraft Assets**: Airports, ports, and vessels involved in the transportation 
  of weapons, stolen Ukrainian goods, and sanctions circumvention efforts.

  **Vessel captains**: Captains of vessels involved in sanctions circumvention efforts.

  **Propagandists**: Individuals involved in the dissemination of Russian propaganda.

  The objective of the War and Sanctions website is to raise awareness of their conduct,
  and advocate for sanctions against these entities to hold perpetrators accountable and
  deter further actions of this kind.
