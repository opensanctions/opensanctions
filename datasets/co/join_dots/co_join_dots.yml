  Data on Politically Exposed Persons in Colombia from the Joining the Dots project
description: |
  This is a dataset of Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) in Colombia as part of the Joining the Dots project.

  Joining the Dots Colombia is a civil-society project. Their sources are public official
  declarations of assets, the EITI Colombia portal, and state purchasing data from
  Colombia Compra Eficiente.

  From the project site:

  > "Joining the Dots with PEPs" makes available to the public information on 
  > public officials’ Financial Declarations, government procurement and
  > contracting, and contracts and tenders of companies in the extractive 
  > sector, with the aim of identifying possible conflicts of interest,
  > corruption or misuse of public office.
  >
  > To this end, we have developed a platform that compiles, verifies and
  > cross-checks information on politically exposed persons (PEPs) with public
  > data from Financial Declarations, transactions registered on the official
  > Colombia Compra Eficiente website and the list of operating companies in
  > the mining and hydrocarbons industry of EITI Colombia.

  This dataset currently includes Representatives and Senators, with some company
  ownership information added as notes to these political office-holders.
