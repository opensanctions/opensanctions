summary: Persons of Interest (POI) in Russia published by Dossier Center
description: |
  This dataset publishes a list of possible organizers of the Kremlin organized crime group
  and their probable accomplices with brief profiles.

  This list is assembled by independent civil activists to map out the network of
  influence of leadership in the Russian government connected to organized crime.

  Their approach, translated from their website:

  > We refer to investigations already conducted by journalists and civil activists,
  > and we continue these investigations on our own and with the efforts of concerned
  > citizens.
  >
  > The information we collect should serve as the basis for conducting an inspection
  > by law enforcement agencies and subsequent initiation of criminal cases in Russia
  > and abroad.

  > We will be grateful for your help in replenishing and correcting the list, as well
  > as in clarifying the facts and circumstances of the crimes committed and being
  > committed by these persons.
