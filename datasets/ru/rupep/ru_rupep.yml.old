  > The database of public officials of Russia (PEP, Politically exposed person) –

  > organizations, exchanges, etc.) in order to detect Russian PEP and its related
  > persons, and to assess the level of risk associated with servicing such clients.

  > to the site.

  > Financial monitoring subjects can also obtain information from the database in
  > JSON or XML format and receive regular updates for financial monitoring purposes.

  > The use of information obtained from this site for further resale in the form
  > of various analytical products or for other commercial purposes is prohibited.
