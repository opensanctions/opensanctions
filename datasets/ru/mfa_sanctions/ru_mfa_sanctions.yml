  A list of US citizens under personal sanctions by the Russian Federation.
description: |
  This dataset lists US citizens targeted by the Russian Federation with personal sanctions, 
  including their names and positions. These measures, such as travel bans, are part of 
  Russia's broader strategy to counter opposition to its geopolitical actions and policies. 
  The list includes academics, political leaders, and other individuals who have stood in 
  support of democratic values, accountability, and human rights. By naming these individuals, 
  the Russian government aims to silence dissent and deter criticism of its actions on the 
  global stage.

  This dataset serves as a record of such actions and supports international efforts to monitor 
  and respond to authoritarian counter-measures against advocates of democracy and rule of law.
