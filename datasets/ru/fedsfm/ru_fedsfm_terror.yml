  This list contains a large number of targets that seem extremist only 
  in a narrow domestic sense, such as Jehova's Witnesses and Navalny's
  FBK. We will not include this list in the Due Diligence and Consolidated
  Sanctions list to avoid assisting the criminalisation of Russian 
  opposition figures.
