  The South African FIC sanctions list, largely based on UN Security Council sanctions.
description: |
  South African sanctions are largely based on the [UN Security Council sanctions
  list](/datasets/un_sc_sanctions/), with some additions.

  > Sanctions impose restrictions on activities that relate to particular countries,
  > goods and services, or persons and entities. Targeted Financial Sanctions (TFS)
  > measures generally restrict sanctioned persons and entities from having access
  > to funds and property under their control and from receiving financial services
  > in relation to such funds and property.  In order for these sanctions to be given
  > effect, the FIC Act requires Accountable Institutions to freeze property and
  > transactions pursuant to financial sanctions imposed in the United Nations
  > Security Council Resolutions.

  description: |
    The Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) exists to apply measures outlined in
    the Financial Intelligence Centre Act, 2001 (Act 38 of 2001), which are
    intended to make the financial system intolerant to abuse. The FIC does this
    by working towards fulfilling its mandate of assisting in identifying the
    proceeds of crime, combating money laundering, the financing of terrorism
    and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
