  description: |
    The Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) exists to apply measures outlined in
    the Financial Intelligence Centre Act, 2001 (Act 38 of 2001), which are
    intended to make the financial system intolerant to abuse. The FIC does this
    by working towards fulfilling its mandate of assisting in identifying the
    proceeds of crime, combating money laundering, the financing of terrorism
    and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
