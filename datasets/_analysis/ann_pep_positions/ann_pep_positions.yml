  The annotations dataset consists of detail added by the OpenSanctions team
  to improve on the data from our other sources with detail from our knowledge and
  desktop research. This includes e.g. that a position like "Advisor to the
  president of Russia" is a PEP with national government level of influence, while
  "President of the water polo club" might also be a position included in an
  investigative database, but should not be considered a PEP in our dataset.
