    "We are a group of Syrian and Arab youth who, after the great sacrifices
    the Syrian people made during the second decade of the twenty-first
    century, decided to provide the Syrian people and their friends around
    the world with a tool that enables them to tie information together and
    weave knowledge to explore what connects the political, economic, social,
    security, and military actors in Syria in a step toward building a more
    just and healthy society"
