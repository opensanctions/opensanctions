  A list of oiligarchs from CIS countries, most notably the Russian
  Federation.
description: |
  This list was developed by the OpenSanctions team in cooperation with
  [CORRECT!V](https://correctiv.org/) and [Lighthouse Reports](https://www.lighthousereports.nl/).
  It is intended as a starting point for research into oligarch holdings, and a
  benchmark against which sanctions in response to the invasion of Ukraine can
  be evaluated.

  While some of the entries are imported simply on the base of internet research,
  the bulk of the list is sourced from existing lists of key Russian businesspeople
  and political power brokers. It includes persons based on the following sources:

  * US Section 241 CAATSA Report from 2018
  * The [Navalny 35](/dataset/ru_navalny35/)
  * Forbes List of Russian Billionaires 2021
  * Forbes List of Ukrainian Billionaires
