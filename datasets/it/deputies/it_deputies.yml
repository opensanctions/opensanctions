  description: |
    The Chamber of Deputies is the lower house of the Italian Parliament, with the Senate 
    of the Republic serving as the upper house. Together, the two houses form a perfectly 
    bicameral system, meaning they share identical legislative functions but operate 
    independently. The Chamber of Deputies has 400 seats, of which 392 are elected from 
    constituencies within Italy and 8 are reserved for Italian citizens residing abroad.
