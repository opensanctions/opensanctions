  description: |
    The Senate of the Republic (Senato della Repubblica) is the upper house of the
    Parliament of Italy. Alongside the Chamber of Deputies, it forms a perfectly 
    bicameral system, meaning both chambers perform the same legislative functions 
    independently.  The Senate is composed of 200 elected members and a small number 
    of senators for life (senatori a vita), who serve ex officio as former Presidents 
    of the Republic or are appointed by the President for outstanding contributions to 
    the nation in the social, scientific, artistic, or literary fields.
