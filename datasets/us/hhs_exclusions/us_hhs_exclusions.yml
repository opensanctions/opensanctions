  This dataset represents the current
  [List of Excluded Individuals/Entities](https://oig.hhs.gov/exclusions/exclusions_list.asp) (LEIE)
  by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (OIG).

  From the OIG's website:

  > The OIG has the authority to exclude individuals and entities from Federally
  > funded health care programs for a variety of reasons, including a conviction
  > for Medicare or Medicaid fraud. Those that are excluded can receive no payment
  > from Federal health care programs for any items or services they furnish,
  > order, or prescribe. This includes those that provide health benefits funded
  > directly or indirectly by the United States (other than the Federal Employees
  > Health Benefits Plan).

  For more information about exclusion reason references, refer to the
  [OIG's Exclusions FAQ page](https://oig.hhs.gov/faqs/exclusions-faq).
