  by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (OIG).

  From the OIG's website:

  > The OIG has the authority to exclude individuals and entities from Federally
  > funded health care programs for a variety of reasons, including a conviction
  > for Medicare or Medicaid fraud. Those that are excluded can receive no payment
  > from Federal health care programs for any items or services they furnish,
  > order, or prescribe. This includes those that provide health benefits funded
  > directly or indirectly by the United States (other than the Federal Employees
  > Health Benefits Plan).
