  The TennCare Office of Program Integrity maintains a list of providers
  whose Medicaid provider agreement has been terminated.  According to the
  [TennCare Policy Manual](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tenncare/documents2/pi11-002.pdf):

  > All TennCare contractors, subcontractors, and providers are required to screen
  > their owners, employees, and subcontractors both initially and on an ongoing
  > monthly basis, against the HHS-OIG List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE),
  > General Services Administration (GSA) System for Award Management (SAM), and the
  > TennCare Terminated Provider List to identify individuals and entities excluded
  > or debarred from participating in federal health care programs. According to the
  > terms of TennCare’s managed care contracts, MCCs are prohibited from executing
  > provider agreements with providers who have been excluded from participation in
  > federal health care programs pursuant to sections 1128 and 1156 of the Social
  > Security Act. Furthermore, the MCCs’ provider agreements require that providers
  > do not employ or contract with any individual or entity that has been excluded
  > or debarred.
