  Section 1128 and Section 1902(a)(39) of the Social Security Act requires states to provide notice when the
  enrollment of a Medicaid enrolled provider has been terminated “for cause”. Services rendered or ordered by
  sanctioned providers are not eligible for Medicaid reimbursement. In addition, services provided by entities
  owned or managed by sanctioned providers are not eligible for Medicaid reimbursement.
