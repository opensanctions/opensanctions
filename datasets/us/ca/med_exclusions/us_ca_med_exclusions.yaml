description: |
  This dataset contains information about individuals and entities suspended from 
  the California State Medicaid Program. The following text extracted from their website
  explains the reasons a provider might be suspended and the provisions taken:

  > Medi-Cal law, Welfare and Institutions Code (W&I Code), sections 14043.6 and 14123,
  > mandate that the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) suspend a Medi-Cal provider
  > of health care services (provider) from participation in the Medi-Cal program when the
  > individual or entity has:
  > - Been convicted of a felony;
  > - Been convicted of a misdemeanor involving fraud, abuse of the Medi-Cal program or any
  > patient, or otherwise substantially related to the qualifications, functions, or duties
  > of a provider of service;
  > - Been suspended from the federal Medicare or Medicaid programs for any reason;
  > - Lost or surrendered a license, certificate, or approval to provide health care; or
  > - Breached a contractual agreement with the Department that explicitly specifies inclusion
  > on this list as a consequence of the breach.

  > Services rendered, prescribed or ordered by a suspended Medi-Cal provider shall not be
  > covered by the Medi-Cal program while the suspension is in effect. California Code
  > of Regulations, title 22, section 51303, subdivision (k), provides that at least fifteen (15)
  > days written notice be given to all affected providers. This list constitutes such written
  > notice. Although the period of suspension may have expired, reinstatement rights are not
  > automatic. The provider must petition for reinstatement and re-enroll with DHCS before being
  > reimbursed for services rendered. Providers suspended as a result of a Medicare action must
  > appeal through the Medicare office before applying for re-enrollment with Medi-Cal.

  > In accordance with W&amp;I Code, section 14043.61, subdivision (a), a provider of health care
  > services shall be subject to suspension if claims for payment are submitted under any provider
  > number used by the provider to obtain reimbursement from the Medi-Cal program for the services,
  > goods, supplies or merchandise provided, directly or indirectly to a Medi-Cal beneficiary, by
  > an individual or entity that is suspended, excluded or otherwise ineligible because of a sanction
  > to receive, directly or indirectly, reimbursement from the Medi-Cal program and the individual
  > or entity is listed on either the Medi-Cal Suspended and Ineligible Provider List (S&I List)
  > published by DHCS to identify suspended and otherwise ineligible providers, or any list published
  > by the federal Office of Inspector General regarding the suspension or exclusion of individuals
  > or entities from the federal Medicare and Medicaid programs, to identify suspended, excluded
  > or otherwise ineligible providers.
