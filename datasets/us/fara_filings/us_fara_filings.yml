description: |
  The Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) was established in 1938. FARA mandates that 
  certain agents of foreign principals engaged in political or other specified activities 
  must regularly disclose their relationship with the foreign principal, as well as their 
  activities, finances, and expenditures related to those activities. This disclosure allows 
  the government and the American people to assess the activities of these individuals as 
  foreign agents.
