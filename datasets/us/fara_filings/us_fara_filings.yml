description: |
   The Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) was established in 1938. FARA mandates that 
   certain agents of foreign principals engaged in political or other specified activities 
   must regularly disclose their relationship with the foreign principal, as well as their 
   activities, finances, and expenditures related to those activities. This disclosure allows 
   the government and the American people to assess the activities of these individuals as 
   foreign agents.
