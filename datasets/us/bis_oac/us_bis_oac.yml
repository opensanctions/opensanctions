  The antiboycott provisions of the EAR encourage, and in specified cases, require U.S. 
  persons to refuse to participate in unsanctioned foreign boycotts. They have the effect 
  of preventing U.S. persons from advancing foreign policies of other nations that run 
  counter to U.S. policy.

     BIS, part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, manages the intersection of business and 
     U.S. foreign policy and security interests. The Office of Antiboycott Compliance (OAC) 
     within BIS enforces the Anti-Boycott Act of 2018, which discourages and sometimes 
     prohibits U.S. companies from supporting unsanctioned foreign boycotts.
