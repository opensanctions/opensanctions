  Entities reported for making boycott-related requests in U.S. transactions
description: |
  The antiboycott provisions of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) encourage,
  and in specified cases, require U.S. persons to refuse to participate in unsanctioned
  foreign boycotts. They have  the effect of preventing U.S. persons from advancing foreign
  policies of other  nations that run counter to U.S. policy.

  These entities have been
  reported to the BIS for making boycott-related requests in U.S. transactions. The list is
  updated quarterly and is not exhaustive.

    BIS, part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, manages the intersection of business and
    U.S. foreign policy and security interests. The Office of Antiboycott Compliance (OAC)
    within BIS enforces the Anti-Boycott Act of 2018, which discourages and sometimes
    prohibits U.S. companies from supporting unsanctioned foreign boycotts.
