  >   or services furnished, ordered, or prescribed by an excluded individual or entity.
  >   Federal health care programs include Medicare, Medicaid, Denali KidCare and all other
  >   plans and programs that are federally funded, in whole or in part. If a payment is
  >   found to have been made for services provided by an excluded individual or entity,
  >   the payment is considered an overpayment and is subject to recovery under
  >   42 CFR 1001.1901(b).
  >
  >   This payment prohibition applies to the excluded person, anyone who employs or
  >   contracts with the excluded person, or any hospital or other facility where the
  >   excluded person provides services. The exclusion applies regardless of who submits
  >   the claims.
  > - Excluded individuals and entities are published on the Alaska Medical Assistance
  >   Excluded Provider List. Although the provider type shown on the list is the provider
  >   type the individual or entity was at the time of exclusion, an excluded provider is
  >   prohibited from participating or providing services in the Medicaid program in all
  >   categories of service. The exclusion remains in effect until the individual is removed
  >   from this list.
