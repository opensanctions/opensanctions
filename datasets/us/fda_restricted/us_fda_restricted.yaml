  Clinical investigators who have been subject to disqualification proceedings
  regarding FDA-regulated clinical investations
description: |
  The FDA regulates clinical investigators who conduct studies intended to provide
  evidence on the safety and effectiveness of investigational medical products.
  Clinical investigators must follow applicable statutes and regulations to ensure
  the integrity of clinical data and, for studies involving human subjects, to
  protect their rights, safety, and welfare.
  
  If the FDA determines that a clinical investigator has violated these requirements
  — such as through data falsification or non-compliance — it may initiate a
  disqualification proceeding.

  This dataset lists investigators who have been subject to an administrative clinical
  investigator disqualification action, and indicates the current status of that action.
