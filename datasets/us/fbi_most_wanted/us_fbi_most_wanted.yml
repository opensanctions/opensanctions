  From the WIKI page [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI_Ten_Most_Wanted_Fugitives):

  > The FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives is a most wanted list maintained by the United States's Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
  > The list arose from a conversation held in late 1949 between J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the FBI, and William Kinsey Hutchinson,
  > International News Service (the predecessor of the United Press International) editor-in-chief,
  > who were discussing ways to promote capture of the FBI's "toughest guys".
  >
  > This discussion turned into a published article, which received so much positive publicity that on March 14, 1950,
  > the FBI officially announced the list to increase law enforcement's ability to capture dangerous fugitives.
  > The first person added to the list was Thomas J. Holden,
  > a robber and member of the Holden Keating Gang on the day of the list's inception
