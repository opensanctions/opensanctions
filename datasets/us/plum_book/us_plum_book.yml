  This dataset lists the incumbents in the Periodically Listing Updates to Management (PLUM)
  Reporting data by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and House Committee on Government Reform
  alternately after each Presidential election, but is updated more frequently with
  current incumbents.

  > [The Plum Book] covers positions such as agency heads and their immediate subordinates, policy
  > executives and advisors, and aides who report to these officials. The duties of many
  > such positions may involve advocacy of Administration policies and programs and the
  > incumbents usually have a close and confidential working relationship with the agency
  > or other key officials.

  > * **Executive Schedule** and salary-equivalent positions paid at the rates established for
  > levels I through V of the Executive Schedule;

  > * **Schedule C** positions excepted from the competitive service by the President, or by the
  > Director, Office of Personnel Management, and other positions at the GS-14 and above level
  > excepted from the competitive civil service by law, because of the confidential or
