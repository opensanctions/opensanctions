  > The PAUSE Program lists entities that falsely claim to be registered, licensed,
  > and/or located in the United States in their solicitation of investors. The

  > securities firms as well as fictitious regulators, governmental agencies, or
  > international organizations.

  > You should be aware that the PAUSE lists do not include all unregistered entities,
  > impersonators of genuine firms, fake regulators, or entities that have been
  > the subject of complaints received by the SEC. Also, you should understand that
  > the inclusion of a name on these lists does not mean that the SEC has concluded
  > that a violation of the US securities laws has occurred or that the SEC has made
  > any judgment about the merits of the securities being offered by these entities.

  > You can view the [official SEC release describing and providing more details about this list](https://www.sec.gov/rules/other/2007/34-56534.pdf).
