  Medical providers excluded from Louisiana's Medicaid program.
description: |
  This dataset contains individuals and entities excluded from Louisiana state medicaid program.
  According to their website:

  > Any person or entity is prohibited from participation in Medicaid if excluded, to include:
  > employment directly or indirectly, contracting, or ownership. Doing so while excluded is
  > violation and is considered a crime under LA R.S. 14:126.3.1 (2009). Although the stated
  > period of time for the exclusion may have passed, this does not imply reinstatement. After
  > the exclusion period has ended the excluded party may submit a written application for
  > reinstatement. Resumption of participation in the Medicaid Program following exclusion is
  > neither automatic nor a right. Applications for reinstatement will be reviewed by the
  > state and given fair and impartial consideration. La.-R.S. 46:437.13 (C) (2008).

  Entities on this list due to the OIG LEIE are not re-listed in this dataset.
