  The Denied Persons List is a list of people and companies whose export
  privileges have been denied by the Department of Commerce's Bureau of
  Industry and Security (BIS). An American company or individual may not
  participate in an export transaction with an individual or company on the
  Denied Persons List.

  The Denied Persons List is also included in the [US Trade Consolidated List](/datasets/us_trade_csl/),
  so we may want to remove this crawler at some point.
