  OFAC is providing all of its non-SDN sanctions lists in a consolidated set
  of data called "the Consolidated Sanctions List".
description: |
  In order to make it easier to comply with OFAC's sanctions regulations, OFAC is
  offering all of its non-SDN sanctions lists in a consolidated set of data
  files called "the Consolidated Sanctions List".

  In the future, if OFAC creates a new non-SDN style list, the office will add
  the new data associated with that list to these consolidated data files if
  appropriate. While the consolidated sanctions list data files are not part of OFAC's
  list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons "the SDN List," the records
  in these consolidated files may also appear on the SDN List.
