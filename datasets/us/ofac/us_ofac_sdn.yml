  The primary United States' sanctions list, specially designated nationals (SDN) part.
description: |
  As part of its enforcement efforts, OFAC publishes a list of individuals and
  companies owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, targeted
  countries. It also lists individuals, groups, and entities, such as terrorists
  and narcotics traffickers designated under programs that are not country-specific.
  Collectively, such individuals and companies are called "Specially Designated
  Nationals" or "SDNs." Their assets are blocked and U.S. persons are generally
  prohibited from dealing with them.
