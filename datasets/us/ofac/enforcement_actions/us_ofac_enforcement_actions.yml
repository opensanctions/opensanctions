description: |
  OFAC Enforcement Actions are formal legal proceedings where the U.S. Treasury's Office
  of Foreign Assets Control penalizes individuals, companies, or entities that violate
  American economic sanctions and embargo programs. These actions typically involve civil
  monetary penalties, settlement agreements, or warning letters for violations such as
  conducting business with sanctioned parties, failing to freeze designated assets, or
  having inadequate compliance programs. The enforcement actions serve as both punishment
  for violations and deterrence for others, with OFAC publicly disclosing significant cases
  to provide guidance on sanctions compliance.

  This covers notices since 8 July 2016.
