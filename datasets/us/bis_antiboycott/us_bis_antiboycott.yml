  The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) enforces antiboycott policies under the Export
  Administration Regulations (EAR) to stop U.S. companies from supporting unsanctioned foreign
  boycotts, primarily targeting the Arab League boycott of Israel.

   BIS has enhanced its antiboycott enforcement efforts to prevent U.S. companies from being used to
   support unsanctioned foreign boycotts, most notably the Arab League boycott of Israel. In October
   2022, BIS raised its penalties and instituted a requirement that companies entering into settlement
   agreements for antiboycott violations admit to a statement of facts outlining their conduct. In July
   2023, BIS announced a renewed focus on foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies and noted that it
   would explore additional ways to deter foreign parties from issuing or making boycott requests.

    BIS, part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, manages the intersection of business and
    U.S. foreign policy and security interests. The Office of Antiboycott Compliance (OAC)
    within BIS enforces the Anti-Boycott Act of 2018, which discourages and sometimes
    prohibits U.S. companies from supporting unsanctioned foreign boycotts.
