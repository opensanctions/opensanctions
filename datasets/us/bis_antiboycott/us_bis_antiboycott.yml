  U.S. companies alleged to have violated antiboycott regulations by supporting
  unsanctioned foreign boycotts, primarily the Arab League boycott of Israel.
description: |
  The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) enforces antiboycott policies under
  the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to prevent U.S. companies from
  participating in or supporting unsanctioned foreign boycotts. The primary focus
  is on the Arab League boycott of Israel.

  This dataset lists U.S. companies that have allegedly violated antiboycott
  regulations and have been subject to enforcement actions. These violations
  typically involve responding to boycott-related requests, providing prohibited
  information, or agreeing to discriminatory terms in international transactions.
