  The State of Hawai'i Department of Human Services maintains a list of providers
  who have been excluded from the state program.

   > An excluded provider is an individual or entity that is not allowed to receive
   > reimbursement for providing Medicare and Medicaid services in any capacity,
   > even if they are not on this listing by the Med-QUEST Division.

   > Excluded individuals and entities are listed according to the type of provider
   > they were at the time of exclusion; however, they are excluded from
   > participating in providing services in the Medicaid program in all categories
   > of service and in any capacity.

   > Any provider participating or applying to participate in the Medicaid program
   > must search Hawaiʻi’s excluded provider list monthly and the List of Excluded
   > Individuals and Entities (LEIE) on an annual basis to determine if any existing
   > employee or contractor has been excluded from participation in the Medicaid
   > program. In addition, any provider participating or applying to participate in
   > the Medicaid program must search both lists prior to hiring staff to ensure
   > that any potential employees or contractors have not been excluded from
