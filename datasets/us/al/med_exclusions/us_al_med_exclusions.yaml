  > Excluded Individuals and Entities are not allowed to receive
  > reimbursement for providing Medicare and Medicaid services in any
  > capacity, even if they are not on this listing by the Alabama Medicaid Agency.
  >
  > Excluded individuals and entities are listed according to the type
  > of provider they were at the time of exclusion; however, they are
  > excluded from participating in providing services in the Medicaid
  > program in all categories of service and in any capacity. The exclusion
  > remains in effect until they are removed from this list.
  >
  > Any provider participating or applying to participate in the Medicaid
  > program must search Medicaid's Exclusion List, the List of Excluded
  > Individuals and Entities (LEIE), and the System for Award Management
  > (SAM) website on a monthly basis to determine if any existing employee
  > or contractor has been excluded from participation in the Medicaid program.
  > Also, any provider participating or applying to participate in the Medicaid
  > program must search all three lists prior to hiring staff to ensure that
  > any potential employees or contractors have not been excluded from participating
  > in the Medicaid program.
