  Organizations designated as terrorist for immigration purposes.

  Section 411 of the USA PATRIOT ACT of 2001 (8 U.S.C. ยง 1182) authorized
  the Secretary of State, in consultation with or upon the request of the
  Attorney General, to designate terrorist organizations for immigration purposes.
  This facilitates excluding aliens associated with listed entities from entering
  the United States.

  An organization can be placed on the TEL if the Secretary of State finds that the organization:

    - commits or incites to commit, under circumstances indicating an intention to cause
      death or serious bodily injury, a terrorist activity;
    - prepares or plans a terrorist activity;
    - gathers information on potential targets for terrorist activity; or
    - provides material support to further terrorist activity.
