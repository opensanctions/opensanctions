description: |
  Federal regulation requires states to provide notice when the enrollment of a Medicaid enrolled provider has
  been terminated “for cause”. Services rendered or ordered by sanctioned providers are not eligible for
  Medicaid reimbursement. In addition, services provided by entities owned or managed by sanctioned providers
  are not eligible for Medicaid reimbursement.
