  This dataset lists providers terminated from participation in Indiana Medicaid and CHIP.

  > Federal regulation requires states to provide notice when the enrollment of a
  > Medicaid enrolled provider has been terminated “for cause”. The following list
  > reflects examples of conduct for which provider enrollments may be terminated
  > and meets the definition of “for cause” as defined by CMS. The list is not meant
  > to be exhaustive:
  >
  > - Adverse licensure actions
  > - Federal exclusion
  > - Fraudulent conduct
  > - Abuse of billing privileges
  > - Misuse of billing number
  > - Falsified enrollment information
  > - Falsified medical records

  According to Indiana Office of Medicaid Policy and Planning (OMPP) provider relations,
  Indiana does not have an ‘exclusion’ list. The Provider Termination list that
  is posted on OMPP’s website is simply a means to let individuals or entities
  who may have received services or care from the provider previously, know that
  the provider is not participating with the Medicaid Program due to compliance concerns.

  Providers whose enrollments have been terminated for compliance concerns could
  be eligible to re-enrol when the compliance issues have been resolved.

  > In general, if the provider has requested to enrol with the Medicaid program
  > again and their application has been processed and approved, the “Terminated”
  > list would be updated to remove the provider’s name. However, 
  > the best way to determine if a provider on the Terminated list has re-enrolled
  > with Indiana Medicaid is to use the Provider Locator on our website
  > [Indiana Medicaid: Providers: IHCP Provider Locator](https://www.in.gov/medicaid/providers/provider-references/ihcp-provider-locator/)
  > that can be used to identify the individuals and business entities that are
  > currently enrolled with Indiana Medicaid.
