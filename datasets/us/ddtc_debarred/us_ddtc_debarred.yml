  This dataset contains entities from the Statutory Debarments and the Administrative Debarments
  lists from the US State Department's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls.

  The Statutory Debarments are for individuals and companies who have been convicted
  of violating or conspiracy to violate the Arms Export Control Act (AECA).

  Administrative Deparbments may be imposed by the department for violations of the AECA/ITAR,
  as specified in 22 CFR ยง127.7(a), upon resolution of enforcement proceedings.

  > The statutory debarment list includes only persons who are subject to
  > statutory debarment for convictions of violating or conspiracy to violate
  > the AECA. This is a small subset of persons who may be debarred or ineligible
  > to participate in the export of defense articles and defense services. In other
  > words, the list does not include persons that may be ineligible under other
  > AECA and ITAR prohibitions or restrictions.
  >
  > Although the statutory and administrative debarment lists on this website are
  > periodically updated, notices published in the Federal Register are considered
  > the authoritative source for debarment information.
