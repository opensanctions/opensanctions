  An index of most national-level heads of state and heads of government
  in world governments that is publicly maintained by the CIA.
description: |
  This dataset makes the "chief of state", as labeled here, and head of government,
  available for all countries in the World Factbook which have such roles.

  Where a monarch has a local representative of e.g. an ex-colony, both the
  monarch and any local representatives are generally included.

  The World Factbook source pages contain much more narrative about each country.
  From the website:

  > The World Factbook provides basic intelligence on the history, people,
  > government, economy, energy, geography, environment, communications,
  > transportation, military, terrorism, and transnational issues for 266 world
  > entities.
