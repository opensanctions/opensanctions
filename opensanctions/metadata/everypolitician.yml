prefix: evpo
summary: >
  All members of national parliament in the world, collected from hundreds of
  government web sites and consolidated via Wikidata.
description: |
  The EveryPolitician project ran until 2019 and created a mechanism for consolidating 
  data about members of parliament for 233 different countries and territories. As part
  of the project, EveryPolitician operated a large fleet of crawlers which read the web
  sites of parliaments around the world.

  The project was [shut down in June 2019](https://www.mysociety.org/2019/06/26/placing-everypolitician-on-hold/), 
  leaving the contained data to slowly wither in precision. Going forward, the
  [Peppercat Legislators](/datasets/wd_peppercat_legislators/) dataset will succeed
  EveryPolitician. It generates membership data from Wikidata, which is currently
  incomplete in some jurisdictions. Going forward, the intention is to use the
  EveryPolitician scrapers to update membership data in Wikidata.

  The OpenSanctions importer only includes individuals active since the year 2000.
