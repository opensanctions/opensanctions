  * [Denied Persons List](/datasets/us_bis_denied/) -
    Individuals and entities that have been denied export privileges. Any
    dealings with a party on this list that would violate the terms
    of its denial order are prohibited. 
  * Unverified List - End-users who BIS has been unable to verify in prior
    transactions. The presence of a party on this list in a transaction is a
    “Red Flag” that should be resolved before proceeding with the transaction. 
  * Entity List - Parties whose presence in a transaction can trigger a license
    requirement supplemental to those elsewhere in the Export Administration
    Regulations (EAR). The list specifies the license requirements and policies
    that apply to each listed party. 
  * Military End User (MEU) List - Parties whose presence in a transaction as a
    party to the transaction triggers a license requirement for any item subject
    to the EAR listed in supplement no. 2 to part 744. No license exceptions are
    available for exports, reexports or transfers (in-country) to listed entities
    on the MEU List for items specified in supplement no. 2 to part 744, except
    license exceptions for items authorized under the provisions of License
    Exception GOV set forth in § 740.11(b)(2)(i) and (ii) of the EAR. The license
    application procedure and license review policy for entities specified in
    supplement no. 2 to part 744 is specified in § 744.21(d) and (e).
