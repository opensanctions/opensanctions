  The United Kingom's consolidated international sanctions list.
description: |
  The Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) publishes a list of all
  those subject to financial sanctions imposed by the UK which it keeps updated.

  You can find more information about the [current UK sanctions regimes here](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-sanctions-regimes-under-the-sanctions-act)
  and read the [guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/financial-sanctions-faqs).

  The UK sanctions list suffers from very bad data quality as the result of manual
  data processing and inappropriate data structures used by the XML files.
collections:
  - sanctions
  - default

    OFSI is part of Her Majesty's Treasury. It helps to ensure that financial
    sanctions are properly understood, implemented and enforced in the United Kingdom.
