  South African sanctions are largely based on the [UN Security Council sanctions
  list](https://www.opensanctions.org/datasets/un_sc_sanctions/), with some exceptions.

  > Sanctions impose restrictions on activities that relate to particular countries,
  > goods and services, or persons and entities. Targeted Financial Sanctions (TFS)
  > measures generally restrict sanctioned persons and entities from having access
  > to funds and property under their control and from receiving financial services
  > in relation to such funds and property.  In order for these sanctions to be given
  > effect, the FIC Act requires Accountable Institutions to freeze property and
  > transactions pursuant to financial sanctions imposed in the United Nations
  > Security Council Resolutions.

    intended to make the financial system intolerant to abuse. The FIC does this
    by working towards fulfilling its mandate of assisting in identifying the
    proceeds of crime, combating money laundering, the financing of terrorism
    and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
