title: EU Restrictive measures in view of the situation in Guinea-Bissau
key: EU-GNB
url: https://sanctionsmap.eu/#/main/details/15/
summary: 'EU restrictive measures against Guinea-Bissau were introduced on 3 May 2012.
  Travel restrictions and an asset freeze were imposed targeting those who sought
  to prevent or block a peaceful political process or who took action that undermined
  stability in the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, in particular those who played a leading
  role in the mutiny of 1 April 2010 and the coup d’état of 12 April 2012. The measures
  also target those who sought to undermine the rule of law, curtailing the primacy
  of civilian power and furthering impunity and instability in the country.


  On 18 May 2012, the UN Security Council adopted a Resolution 2048 (2012), which
  imposed a travel ban on persons seeking to prevent the restoration of the constitutional
  order or taking action that undermines stability in the Republic of Guinea-Bissau.
  This restrictive measures regime includes both Council of the EU and UN Security
  Council designations.


  Derogations to the restrictive measures are possible as well as exemptions for humanitarian
  purposes.'
