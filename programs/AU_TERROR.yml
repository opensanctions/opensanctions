summary: Established under the Criminal Code Act 1995, Australia's regime designates
  organisations as terrorist entities based on their involvement in terrorist activities.
  Designations are made through court determinations or formal listings in Regulations,
  following statutory procedures. The listing process now continues indefinitely,
  reflecting amendments from the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Prohibited
  Hate Symbols and Other Measures) Act 2023.
