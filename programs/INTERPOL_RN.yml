title: INTERPOL Red Notices
key: INTERPOL-RN
url: https://www.interpol.int/en/How-we-work/Notices/Red-Notices
summary: 'INTERPOL Red Notices are established under the INTERPOL Constitution (1956)
  and governed by the Rules on the Processing of Data (RPD), particularly Articles
  82-87. The legal framework empowers INTERPOL member countries to request international
  alerts for persons wanted for prosecution or to serve sentences for serious ordinary-law
  crimes, subject to constitutional safeguards under Articles 2 and 3 prohibiting
  political, military, religious, or racial interventions.


  Red Notices serve as requests to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally
  arrest persons pending extradition or surrender, but do not constitute international
  arrest warrants and require compliance with each member country''s domestic laws.
  Inclusion on a Red Notice indicates that a person is internationally wanted by a
  member country''s judicial authorities for serious criminal offenses, subject to
  review by INTERPOL''s Notices and Diffusions Task Force for constitutional and legal
  compliance.'
