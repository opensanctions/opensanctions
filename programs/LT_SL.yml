summary: The Financial Crimes Investigation Service (FNTT) under Lithuania's Ministry
  of the Interior maintains a separate list of legal entities or other organizations
  that have been determined by the FNTT to be owned or controlled by sanctioned entities.
  This list identifies Lithuanian-based entities whose property is legally owned or
  controlled by a sanctioned entity and are therefore subject to asset freezes, operating
  as a complement to the main international sanctions lists from the UN and EU.
