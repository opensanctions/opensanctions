key: US-FTO219
url: https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF10613#
summary: 'Pursuant to Section 219 of the INA, the Secretary of State is authorized
  to designate an organization as an FTO if such an entity meets three criteria: the
  suspected terrorist group must (1) be a foreign organization; (2) engage in "terrorist
  activity," "terrorism," or retain the capability and intent to engage in terrorist
  activity or terrorism; and (3) threaten the security of U.S. nationals or the national
  defense, foreign relations, or economic interests of the United States.


  Section 219 of the INA relies on the definition of "terrorist activity" in Section
  212(a)(3)(B) of the INA (8 U.S.C. §1182(a)(3)(B)) and the definition of "terrorism"
  in Section 140(d)(2) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1988
  and 1989 (FRAA, P.L. 100-204, as amended; 22 U.S.C. §2656f(d)(2)).'
