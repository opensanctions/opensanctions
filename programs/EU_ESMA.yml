title: Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II
key: EU-ESMA
url: https://www.esma.europa.eu/publications-and-data/interactive-single-rulebook/mifid-ii
summary: 'The MiFID II Suspensions and Removals Register is established under Articles
  32 and 52 of Directive 2014/65/EU (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II),
  which came into force in January 2018. This regulatory framework empowers national
  competent authorities and ESMA to suspend or remove financial instruments from trading
  to maintain market integrity and protect investors.


  The regime serves to provide transparency on trading restrictions imposed due to
  regulatory concerns, market manipulation, or other circumstances that may harm investor
  interests. Inclusion in this register indicates that specific financial instruments
  are either temporarily suspended from trading or permanently removed from regulated
  markets across the EU.'
