summary: 'The measures were initially imposed on 15 October 1999. On 17 June 2011,
  the United Nations'' Security Council adopted resolutions 1988 (2011) and 1989 (2011)
  and decided that the list of individuals and entities subject to restrictive measures
  originally imposed by resolution 1267 (1999) would be split in two. The original
  resolution 1267 (1999) concerns Afganistan and the Taliban. Now the resolution is
  concerning ISIL (Da''esh), Al-Qaida and associated individuals, groups, undertakings
  and entities. The measures imposed with respect to the Taliban are described under
  this restrictive measures regime. The measures imposed on ISIL (Da''esh) and Al-Qaida
  are described under the thematic restrictive measures section.


  Derogations to the restrictive measures are possible as well as exemptions for humanitarian
  purposes.'
