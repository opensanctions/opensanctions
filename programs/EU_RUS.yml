summary: 'Entities listed under these programs may be subject to only one of them.

  This regime covers the European Union''s sanctions imposed on Russia under two main
  frameworks:


  Restrictive measures in view of the situation in Russia:

  In response to the accelerating repression, deteriorating human rights situation,
  and the death of opposition politician Alexei Navalny, the EU adopted a framework
  targeting individuals and entities responsible for serious human rights violations,
  repression of civil society, and undermining democracy and the rule of law. Measures
  include asset freezes, travel bans, and restrictions on equipment for internal repression.


  Restrictive measures in view of Russia''s actions destabilising the situation in
  Ukraine:

  Adopted progressively since 2014, and expanded following Russia’s 2022 military
  aggression, these measures target Russia’s economic and military capabilities. Sanctions
  include restrictions on dual-use goods, financial transactions, oil imports, trade
  in Russian diamonds, and advanced technologies, alongside measures to prevent circumvention
  of sanctions.'
