key: EU-SOM
url: https://sanctionsmap.eu/#/main/details/29/
summary: 'Measures imposed at UN level since UN Security Council Resolution 733 (1992)
  of 23 January 1992 and subsequent Resolutions are transposed into EU sanctions law.
  The measures include an arms embargo, which is partial and allows under certain
  conditions arms supplies for the development of Somalia''s security and police institutions.
  In addition the measures include a ban on the direct or indirect import of charcoal
  from Somalia and a prohibition of the direct or indirect sale, supply or transfer
  to Somalia of listed items if there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the
  item(s) will be used, or a significant risk they may be used, in the manufacture
  in Somalia of improvised explosive devices (IEDs). The measures also cover targeted
  individual sanctions on designated persons and entities (asset freeze and prohibition
  from making funds and economic resources available as well as travel restrictions).


  Derogations to the restrictive measures are possible as well as exemptions for humanitarian
  purposes.'
