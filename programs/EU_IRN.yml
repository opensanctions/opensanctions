key: EU-IRN
url: https://sanctionsmap.eu/#/main/details/17,18,56/
summary: 'The EU has imposed sanctions against Iran in response to its human rights
  abuses, nuclear proliferation activities and military support for Russia''s war
  of aggression against Ukraine.


  Entities may only be sanctioned under one specific program, such as those related
  to human rights violations or non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.


  Human Rights Violations: EU sanctions since 2011 target individuals involved in
  repressing peaceful protests, journalists, and human rights defenders in Iran, with
  travel bans, asset freezes, and restrictions on repressive equipment.


  Non-Proliferation of WMD: Sanctions, aligned with UN measures, restrict Iran’s nuclear
  and missile activities. Some sanctions were lifted after the 2015 JCPoA but remain
  in place due to non-compliance.


  Military Support to Russia and Armed Groups: In 2023, the EU imposed sanctions on
  Iran for supplying UAVs to Russia and supporting armed groups, including travel
  bans, asset freezes, and export restrictions.'
