summary: Australia implements the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) related to
  the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) by incorporating them into Australian
  law. In addition, since 2006 Australia has imposed autonomous sanctions in relation
  to the DPRK, which complement the UNSC sanctions. The autonomous sanctions were
  imposed in response to Australia’s concerns about the nature of the DPRK’s nuclear,
  weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and proliferation programs.
