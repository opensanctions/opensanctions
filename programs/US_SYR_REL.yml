summary: 'These sanctions target individuals and entities involved in obstructing
  a political solution to the conflict in Syria, committing human rights abuses, or
  supporting the Assad regime. The measures include asset freezes and prohibitions
  on transactions to pressure the Syrian government and other actors to engage in
  peace negotiations and respect human rights.


  On June 30, 2025, President Trump issued an Executive Order (E.O. of June 30, 2025)
  that removes U.S. sanctions on Syria, effective July 1, 2025. Sanctions will remain
  on Bashar al-Assad and his associates, human rights abusers, Captagon traffickers,
  persons linked to Syria''s past proliferation activities, ISIS and Al-Qa''ida affiliates,
  and Iran and its proxies. [Source: Official Website](https://ofac.treasury.gov/sanctions-programs-and-country-information/paarss)'
