title: EU sanctions related to Ukraine
key: EU-UKR
url: https://sanctionsmap.eu/#/main/details/35,36/
summary: 'Entities listed under these programs may be subject to only one of them.
  This regime covers the European Union''s sanctions related to Ukraine under two
  main frameworks:


  * **Misappropriation of State Funds**: In response to the violence and political
  instability in Ukraine, the EU adopted measures targeting individuals identified
  as responsible for the misappropriation of Ukrainian state funds and human rights
  violations. These measures aim to support the rule of law and respect for human
  rights. Sanctions include asset freezes and prohibitions on making funds available.


  * **Territorial Integrity of Ukraine**: The EU imposed asset freezes and travel
  bans on individuals and entities responsible for actions undermining Ukraine''s
  territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence. This followed Russia’s illegal
  annexation of Crimea and the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Sanctions were progressively
  expanded to target those supporting the Russian government, providing substantial
  revenue, and benefitting from its actions. These measures also address the involvement
  of Belarus in the aggression. Derogations allow for humanitarian aid delivery.'
