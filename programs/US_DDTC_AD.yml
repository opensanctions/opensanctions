summary: The US Department of State's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC)
  maintains the Administrative Debarment List under 22 CFR Section 127.7(a) of the
  International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). This list includes persons subject
  to administrative debarment. Unlike statutory debarments which result from criminal
  convictions, administrative debarments are civil enforcement actions that prohibit
  designated persons from participating in defense trade activities.
