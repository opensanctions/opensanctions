  summary: >-
    The measures were initially imposed on 15 October 1999. On 17 June 2011, the
    United Nations' Security Council adopted resolutions 1988 (2011) and 1989
    (2011) and decided that the list of individuals and entities subject to
    restrictive measures originally imposed by resolution 1267 (1999) would be
    split in two. The original resolution 1267 (1999) concerns Afganistan and
    the Taliban. Now the resolution is concerning ISIL (Da'esh), Al-Qaida and
    associated individuals, groups, undertakings and entities. The measures
    imposed with respect to the Taliban are described under this restrictive
    measures regime. The measures imposed on ISIL (Da'esh) and Al-Qaida are
    described under the thematic restrictive measures section.


    Derogations to the restrictive measures are possible as well as exemptions
    for humanitarian purposes.

  key: EU-GNB
  url: https://sanctionsmap.eu/#/main/details/15/
  summary: >-
    EU restrictive measures against Guinea-Bissau were introduced on 3 May 2012.
    Travel restrictions and an asset freeze were imposed targeting those who
    sought to prevent or block a peaceful political process or who took action
    that undermined stability in the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, in particular
    those who played a leading role in the mutiny of 1 April 2010 and the coup
    d’état of 12 April 2012. The measures also target those who sought to
    undermine the rule of law, curtailing the primacy of civilian power and
    furthering impunity and instability in the country.


    On 18 May 2012, the UN Security Council adopted a Resolution 2048 (2012),
    which imposed a travel ban on persons seeking to prevent the restoration of
    the constitutional order or taking action that undermines stability in the
    Republic of Guinea-Bissau. This restrictive measures regime includes both
    Council of the EU and UN Security Council designations.


    Derogations to the restrictive measures are possible as well as exemptions

    A financial and trade embargo was adopted by the UN Security Council in 1990
    after the invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990 by the military forces of Iraq
    (see Resolution 661 (1990)).


    Recognising and welcoming the efforts made by Iraq to form a government
    based on the rule of law that affords equal rights and justice to all Iraqi
    citizens, on 22 May 2003 the Security Council lifted all restrictive
    measures against Iraq, except for the arms embargo (see Resolution 1483
    (2003)). Currently, only specific restrictions apply in the areas of trade
    in goods belonging to Iraq’s cultural heritage and an asset freeze
    specifically targeting former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, his immediate
    family, and senior officials of his regime.

    Entities listed under these programs may be subject to only one of them. 

    This regime covers the European Union's sanctions imposed on Russia under
    two main frameworks:


    Restrictive measures in view of the situation in Russia:

    In response to the accelerating repression, deteriorating human rights
    situation, and the death of opposition politician Alexei Navalny, the EU
    adopted a framework targeting individuals and entities responsible for
    serious human rights violations, repression of civil society, and
    undermining democracy and the rule of law. Measures include asset freezes,
    travel bans, and restrictions on equipment for internal repression.


    Restrictive measures in view of Russia's actions destabilising the situation
    in Ukraine:

    Adopted progressively since 2014, and expanded following Russia’s 2022
    military aggression, these measures target Russia’s economic and military
    capabilities. Sanctions include restrictions on dual-use goods, financial
    transactions, oil imports, trade in Russian diamonds, and advanced
    technologies, alongside measures to prevent circumvention of sanctions.

    Measures imposed at UN level since UN Security Council Resolution 733 (1992)

    a ban on the direct or indirect import of charcoal from Somalia and a
    prohibition of the direct or indirect sale, supply or transfer to Somalia of
    listed items if there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the item(s)
    will be used, or a significant risk they may be used, in the manufacture in
    Somalia of improvised explosive devices (IEDs). The measures also cover
    targeted individual sanctions on designated persons and entities (asset

  title: EU Restrictive measures in view of the situation in Zimbabwe
  key: EU-ZWE
  url: https://sanctionsmap.eu/#/main/details/40/
  summary: >-
    Restrictive measures were first introduced on 18 February 2002 in relation
    to the situation in Zimbabwe, in particular the escalation of violence and
    intimidation of political opponents and the harassment of the independent
    press. The Council of the EU expressed serious concern about legislation in
    Zimbabwe which seriously infringed on the right to freedom of speech,
    assembly and association and the legislation to regulate the media. The
    Government of Zimbabwe continued to engage in serious violations of human
    rights and of the freedom of opinion, of association and of peaceful
    assembly. Thus the Council of the EU imposed embargo on arms and equipment
    which might be used for internal repression, travel restrictions and asset
    freeze.


    In 2008, the Council of the EU strengthened the restrictive measures in
    relation to the violence organised and committed by the Zimbabwean
    authorities during the presidential election campaign in 2008, which turned
    the election into a denial of democracy.


    On 23 July 2012 and 18 February 2013, the Council of the EU concluded that a
    peaceful and credible constitutional referendum in Zimbabwe would represent
    an important milestone in the preparation of democratic elections justifying
    an immediate suspension of the majority of all remaining Union targeted
    restrictive measures against individuals and entities. In view of the
    outcome of the Zimbabwean constitutional referendum of 16 March 2013, the
    Council of the EU decided to suspend the travel ban and asset freeze
    applying to the majority of the individuals and entities on the list.


    On 17 February 2022, the Council of the EU decided to delete three persons
    from the list of persons and entities subject to restrictive measures. At
    the moment, the measures remains in force for the listed entity.

    The EU has imposed sanctions against Iran in response to its human rights
    abuses, nuclear proliferation activities and military support for Russia's
    war of aggression against Ukraine.


    Entities may only be sanctioned under one specific program, such as those
    related to human rights violations or non-proliferation of weapons of mass
    destruction.


    Human Rights Violations: EU sanctions since 2011 target individuals involved
    in repressing peaceful protests, journalists, and human rights defenders in
    Iran, with travel bans, asset freezes, and restrictions on repressive
    equipment.


    Non-Proliferation of WMD: Sanctions, aligned with UN measures, restrict
    Iran’s nuclear and missile activities. Some sanctions were lifted after the
    2015 JCPoA but remain in place due to non-compliance.


    Military Support to Russia and Armed Groups: In 2023, the EU imposed
    sanctions on Iran for supplying UAVs to Russia and supporting armed groups,
    including travel bans, asset freezes, and export restrictions.

    Entities listed under these programs may be subject to only one of them.
    This regime covers the European Union's sanctions related to Ukraine under
    two main frameworks:


    * **Misappropriation of State Funds**: In response to the violence and
    political instability in Ukraine, the EU adopted measures targeting
    individuals identified as responsible for the misappropriation of Ukrainian
    state funds and human rights violations. These measures aim to support the
    rule of law and respect for human rights. Sanctions include asset freezes
    and prohibitions on making funds available.


    * **Territorial Integrity of Ukraine**: The EU imposed asset freezes and
    travel bans on individuals and entities responsible for actions undermining
    Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence. This
    followed Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea and the invasion of Ukraine
    in 2022. Sanctions were progressively expanded to target those supporting
    the Russian government, providing substantial revenue, and benefitting from
    its actions. These measures also address the involvement of Belarus in the
    aggression. Derogations allow for humanitarian aid delivery.

    In several of its Conclusions in 2022 and 2023 the Council strongly
    condemned Russian hybrid attacks threatening democracy, the rule of law,
    stability or security in the Union, its Member States and its partners, in
    the context of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine.


    In view of Russia’s continued hybrid campaign operations on European soil
    intended to harm, weaken and divide the Member States and its neighbourhood,
    on 8 October 2024, the Council established a new framework of targeted
    sanctions against Russia-driven persons and entities engaged in
    destabilising activities. the new sanctions framework covers activities such
    as, sabotage, foreign information manipulation, electoral interference,
    disinformation, malicious cyber activities and the instrumentalization of
    migrants by third countries.


    These restrictive measures consist of a travel ban to the EU for designated
    individuals and an asset freeze applying to both designated individuals and
    entities. Additionally, EU persons and entities are prohibited from making
    funds and economic resources available to those listed, either directly or
    indirectly.
