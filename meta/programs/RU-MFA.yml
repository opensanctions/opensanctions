summary: US citizens targeted by the Russian Federation with personal sanctions, including
  their names and positions. These measures, such as travel bans, are part of Russia's
  broader strategy to counter opposition to its geopolitical actions and policies.
  The list includes academics, political leaders, and other individuals who have stood
  in support of democratic values, accountability, and human rights. By naming these
  individuals, the Russian government aims to silence dissent and deter criticism
  of its actions on the global stage.
