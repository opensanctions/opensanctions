summary: 'In several of its Conclusions in 2022 and 2023 the Council strongly condemned
  Russian hybrid attacks threatening democracy, the rule of law, stability or security
  in the Union, its Member States and its partners, in the context of Russia’s war
  of aggression against Ukraine.


  In view of Russia’s continued hybrid campaign operations on European soil intended
  to harm, weaken and divide the Member States and its neighbourhood, on 8 October
  2024, the Council established a new framework of targeted sanctions against Russia-driven
  persons and entities engaged in destabilising activities. the new sanctions framework
  covers activities such as, sabotage, foreign information manipulation, electoral
  interference, disinformation, malicious cyber activities and the instrumentalization
  of migrants by third countries.


  These restrictive measures consist of a travel ban to the EU for designated individuals
  and an asset freeze applying to both designated individuals and entities. Additionally,
  EU persons and entities are prohibited from making funds and economic resources
  available to those listed, either directly or indirectly.'
