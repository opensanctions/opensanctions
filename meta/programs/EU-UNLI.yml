summary: 'New listings of entities or individuals by the United Nations (UN) Security
  Council under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations may be associatd
  with a program code `UNLI` when listed in the EU Consolidated Sanctions list.


  The European Union transposes all UN designations into the EU framework of restrictive
  measures (sanctions). The "UNLI" designation serves as a provisional marker within
  the [Consolidated list of persons, groups and entities subject to EU financial sanction](https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/consolidated-list-of-persons-groups-and-entities-subject-to-eu-financial-sanctions?locale=en)s,
  acting as a preliminary alert for operators during the interim period before the
  adoption and publication of the relevant EU legal acts in the [Official Journal](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/oj/direct-access.html)
  (OJ).


  Once the legal acts are published on the OJ, the "UNLI" designation will be appropriately
  reclassified under the relevant EU legal base within the Consolidated list.'
