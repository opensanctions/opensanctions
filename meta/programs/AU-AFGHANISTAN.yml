summary: Australia introduced an autonomous sanctions framework in relation to Afghanistan
  in December 2025. This framework was developed in response to the ongoing oppression
  of women and girls, minority groups, and the general population in Afghanistan,
  and the undermining of good governance or the rule of law, since the Taliban claimed
  authority over the country in August 2021.
