summary: This list is maintained by BIS and includes entities that are deemed to be
  military end-users. These entities are subject to additional export control restrictions
  to prevent the diversion of U.S. goods and technologies for military use in ways
  that could undermine U.S. national security. The list ensures that exports to these
  entities are carefully monitored and controlled.
