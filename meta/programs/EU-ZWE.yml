title: EU Restrictive measures in view of the situation in Zimbabwe
key: EU-ZWE
url: https://sanctionsmap.eu/#/main/details/40/
summary: 'Restrictive measures were first introduced on 18 February 2002 in relation
  to the situation in Zimbabwe, in particular the escalation of violence and intimidation
  of political opponents and the harassment of the independent press. The Council
  of the EU expressed serious concern about legislation in Zimbabwe which seriously
  infringed on the right to freedom of speech, assembly and association and the legislation
  to regulate the media. The Government of Zimbabwe continued to engage in serious
  violations of human rights and of the freedom of opinion, of association and of
  peaceful assembly. Thus the Council of the EU imposed embargo on arms and equipment
  which might be used for internal repression, travel restrictions and asset freeze.


  In 2008, the Council of the EU strengthened the restrictive measures in relation
  to the violence organised and committed by the Zimbabwean authorities during the
  presidential election campaign in 2008, which turned the election into a denial
  of democracy.


  On 23 July 2012 and 18 February 2013, the Council of the EU concluded that a peaceful
  and credible constitutional referendum in Zimbabwe would represent an important
  milestone in the preparation of democratic elections justifying an immediate suspension
  of the majority of all remaining Union targeted restrictive measures against individuals
  and entities. In view of the outcome of the Zimbabwean constitutional referendum
  of 16 March 2013, the Council of the EU decided to suspend the travel ban and asset
  freeze applying to the majority of the individuals and entities on the list.


  On 17 February 2022, the Council of the EU decided to delete three persons from
  the list of persons and entities subject to restrictive measures. At the moment,
  the measures remains in force for the listed entity.'
